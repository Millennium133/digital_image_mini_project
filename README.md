The dataset that we used is CERTH dataset. The referenced dataset source is http://mklab.iti.gr/files/imageblur/CERTH_ImageBlurDataset.zip. 

With spatial pyramid and fourier transform, we get an accuracy of 85.5%. The dataset consists of undistorted, naturally-blurred and artificailly-blurred images.
